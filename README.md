Hello I'm SleepyTealCoder - also known as Kiri!

## Summary

I usually write code in C and C++ in my day job. Outside of this, I tend to stream my learnings with other languages (like Kotlin and TypeScript) with my own personal projects.

## Purposes for this account

- Contribute code to projects and software used on/for the stream
- Collaborate with fellow developers
- Store a copy of useful scripts/templates via Gist (https://gist.github.com/SleepyTealCoder)
- Release code when appropriate via repositories here (to be also mirrored offsite)

## Current project on stream

On stream Twitch notifications:

- Server
- Test Server
- Desktop Client

## Recent projects & learnings done on stream

- OBS/Twitch Controller (1st iteration)
- Soundboard (1st & 2nd iterations)
- Kotlin & Android Basics with Compose training

## Further information
